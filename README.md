The website uses jekyll. Folks working on this can install jekyll for their personal machines by following instructions 

1. Open command line, terminal, git bash, or whatever is appropriate for your OS.
2. `ruby --version` - make sure you have at least 2.0.0 or higher, if not then need to update / install latest version
3. `gem install bundler` - installs the bundler gem
4. Clone the `promise-zones/promise-zones.github.io` repo somewhere, then cd into the repo folder.
5. `bundle install` - install stuff needed specific to the site
6. `bundle exec jekyll serve` - now you can access on localhost:4000

Note: skip to the last step once you've gone through the steps once to start up the "local server". Now when you make changes in your local copy of the files, you can test them out at localhost:4000
